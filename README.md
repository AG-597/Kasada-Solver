# What Is This?
For some websites liek twitch they don't have a visible captcha, they detect bots using kasada

You can use the values generated here to get those values

This is very flagged and may get blocked a lot due to being made with browser

# Usage

Please simply run `kasada.py` & it will begin generating the time stamp and CT values

# INFO

For an unflagged, faster version [avg 0.0002s] which also collects other values such as `x-kspdk-cd` please join the discord
